# GraphQL Sprout

> Grow SQL queries from the root up! ðŸŒ±

## Usage

**Step 1:** Specify the views that will be used by your models using plain SQL

```sql
-- views/Person.sql

SELECT
  id,
  full_name
FROM person
```

Here we're using a single table, but views can be queries of arbitrary complexity, including joins, subqueries, etc.

**Step 2:** Generate the views from the SQL files using the CLI

```shell
graphql-sprout views/*.sql generated/views.ts
```

This creates a TypeScript file for you like this:

```typescript
export const views = {
  Person: {
    name: "Person",
    query: `
      SELECT
        id,
        full_name
      FROM person;
    `,
    columns: {
      id: {
        kind: "integer",
      } as const,
      full_name: {
        kind: "text",
      } as const,
    },
    type: {} as { id: number; full_name: string },
  },
  // and more...
};
```

**Step 3:** Create your models

```typescript
// Person.ts

import { createModel } from "graphql-sprout";
import { views } from "../views";

export const Person = createModel({
  name: "Person",
  view: views.Person,
  fields: ({ field, virtualField }) => {
    return [
      // Regular fields map directly to columns in your view
      field({
        name: "id",
      }),
      // Virtual fields let you specify a dependency on one or more columns and provide custom resolver logic
      virtualField({
        name: "fullName",
        // Note: this is an arbitrary example. In practice, you'd just return "fullName" as a column on your view.
        columns: ["full_name"],
        // The resolver here is correctly typed based on the generated view
        resolve: ({ full_name }) => full_name,
        // For regular columns, the types are implied from the view columns, but here we have to specify our own
        type: "String!",
      }),
    ];
  },
});
```

Relationships are defined separately from models to avoid issues with circular dependencies.

```typescript
// PersonRelationships.ts

import { createRelationships } from "graphql-sprout";
import { Person } from "./Person";
import { Post } from "./Post";

export const PersonRelationships = createRelationships(({ oneToMany }) => [
  oneToMany({
    name: "posts",
    models: [Person, Post],
    // How the two models will be joined by the query builder. Each parameter here is typed based on the model's associated view columns
    join: (person, post) => sql`${person.id} = ${post.person_id}`,
  }),
]);
```

**Step 4:** Use your models to generate components for a base GraphQL schema

```typescript
import { createSchemaComponents } from "graphql-sprout";
import { Person } from "./Person";
import { PersonRelationships } from "./PersonRelationships";
import { Post } from "./Post";

const {
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  schema,
  createQueryBuilder,
} = await createSchemaComponents({
  models: { Person, Post },
  relationships: [...PersonRelationships],
});
```

This generates base type definitions and resolvers that you can build on top of when creating your schema.

```graphql
type PageInfo {
  endCursor: String!
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String!
}

type PersonPostsConnection {
  edges: [PersonPostsEdge!]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
}

type PersonPostsEdge {
  cursor: String!
  node: Post!
}

type Person {
  id: Int!
  fullName: String!
  posts(
    after: String
    before: String
    first: Int
    last: Int
  ): PersonPostsConnection!
}

type PostLikedByConnection {
  edges: [PostLikedByEdge!]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
}

type PostLikedByEdge {
  cursor: String!
  node: Person!
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  body: String!
  likedBy(
    after: String
    before: String
    first: Int
    last: Int
  ): PostLikedByConnection!
}
```

> Note: In addition to typeDefs and resolvers, `createSchemaComponents` also returns a schema object. While this schema cannot be used on its own (it has no root types), it can be used with tools like GraphQL Code Generator and the GraphQL VS Code extension as shown [here](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/docs/getting-started/schema-field#javascript-export).

**Step 5:** Use the query builder inside your schema to generate complete SQL queries right from the root of your schema.

```typescript
import { createPool } from "slonik";

const pool = createPool("postgres://");
const queryBuilder = createQueryBuilder(pool);
```

Then in your resolver:

```typescript
function resolve(parent, args, ctx, info) {
  return ctx.queryBuilder.models.Person.getRelayConnection({
    info,
    where: (person) => sql`${person.full_name} ilike 'c%'`,
    orderBy: (person) => [[person.id, "DESC"]],
  });
}
```

The query builder will inspect your request using the `info` parameter and build a single database query based on it.
